    "summary": "ReLoad is the seventh album by American heavy metal band Metallica, released November 18, 1997. The album is a direct sequel or counterpart to the band's previous album, Load. Drummer Lars Ulrich stated that: \"it's the second half of Load. It's just coming out a year-and-a-half later.\" To date, the album has sold over 4 million copies in the US, and is certified Gold in the UK, having sold over 100,000 copies.\n\nThe original idea was to make Metallica's seventh album, a double album. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Metallica/Reload\">Read more on Last.fm</a>."
